# Topic 4: Eigenvalue Decomposition (EVD)

When discussing $EVD$, even for real matrices, we can not avoid $\C$ because generally characteristic polynomials only splitt to linear factors in $\C$.

In this class, we use $\C$ for some of the theory but only explore algorithms on subclasses of matrices (real, symmetric)

which are guaranteed to have real eigenvalues.

## Definition: Eigen Pair

Let $A \in \C^{n \times n} (\text {or } \R^{n \times n})$. An ==eigenvalue== of $A$ is a scalar $\lambda \in \C$ s.t. $\exists v \in \C^n$ called ==eigenvector ($v\neq 0$)==, satisfying that $Av = \lambda v$. The pair ==$(\lambda, v)$ is called an eigenpair of $A$.==
